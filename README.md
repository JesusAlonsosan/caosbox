CaosBox
==========

CaosBox 0.08 is a LiveCoding/AlgoRaving music GUI secuencer/procesor for the CaosPercLib Pseudo-Class library, written in SuperCollider.

Place the - caosperclib-master - folder in your SuperCollider Extensions folder.
" (/usr/share/SuperCollider/Extensions) or (/home/username/.local/share/SuperCollider/Extensions) ".
You can download it here: https://github.com/josecaos/caosperclib

The idea is: Improvising;
	By coding caosperclib Classes you can route and give shape to the signal, sequencing and mixing fast in the GUI, Each sequencer step becomes one independent node in server memory, this box was made for LiveCoding. }:]
	
Instructions:
		->1- Open file CaosBox-v0.08.scd and evaluate the indicated text:
			+ welcome sound, GUI and CaosBox_liveCodePad-default.scd file automatically opens.
		->2- First: Go to CaosBox_liveCodePad-default.scd, manipulate the Class arguments within functions or Tdefs and evaluate them:
			+ so you can route and change sound qualities.
		->3- Then: Go to CaosBox GUI: 
			+ start filling the checkbox sequencer on its respective instrument channel and alter the signal route with faders and buttons.
		->4- Improvise, have fun and algorave a lot.

Note:
-No audio buffers, only synthesis. Without "caosperclib" won't work.		

Tested on SuperCollider 3.5.3 and above on Linux, Windows and OSX.

Work in progress.
