//CaosBox Recorded Folder
This folder is used to store all recorded audio data from Caosbox GUI
Each file contains a unique name and a final 4 digit code to identify it
along a saved History file, saved in its own Histories folder.

//
Please note, it already contains a short audio sample, due to the uncompressed
format of the output is only a small part of a long trip.
