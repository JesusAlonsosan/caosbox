CaosBox v1.1
=======
Is a not-so-common LiveCoding/AlgoRave music GUI secuencer/processor for the CaosPercLib Pseudo-Class library, written in SuperCollider.
##
You can download library here: https://github.com/josecaos/caosperclib/releases
Unzip and place the - caosperclib-1.0 - folder here:  Platform.userExtensionDir;

##
The idea is: Improvising;
	By changing arguments in CaosBox_liveCodePad-default.scd file you can route and give shape to the signal. Sequence, mix and automate in the GUI, Each percussion sequence step act as one independent node in server memory, this box was made for LiveCoding.  }:]
##
Instructions:
##
		->1- Open file CaosBox.scd and evaluate the indicated text:
			+ welcome sound, GUI and CaosBox_liveCodePad-default.scd file automatically opens.
##
		->2- First: Go to CaosBox_liveCodePad-default.scd, manipulate the Class arguments within functions or Tdefs and evaluate them:
			+ so you can route and change sound qualities.
##
		->3- Then: Go to CaosBox GUI:
			+ start filling the checkbox sequencer on its respective instrument channel and alter the signal route with faders and buttons.
##
		->4- Improvise, have fun and algorave a lot.
