//CaosBox Histories Folder
This folder is used to store all input data since CaosBox starts, until you push
the save/history button on GUI. Each file contains a unique name and 
a final 4 digit code to identify it along a saved Audio file, saved in its 
own Recorded folder.

//Note
The history is implemented as an effort to recover most of the data from a 
CaosBox session, so it could be replayed, not yet working at all.
Im having problems retrieving input data from GUI, mostly from buttons and faders.  


work in progress
