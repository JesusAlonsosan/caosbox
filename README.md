==========

CaosBox 0.08 is a LiveCoding/AlgoRaving machine for techno/breakbeat music GUI secuencer/procesor for the CaosPercLib PseudoClass library, written in SuperCollider on Linux.

Place the - caosperclib01-master - folder in your SuperCollider Extensions folder.
" (/usr/share/SuperCollider/Extensions) or (/home/username/.local/share/SuperCollider/Extensions) ".
You can download it here: https://github.com/josecaos/caosperclib01

The idea is:
	Each sequencer step becomes one independent node in server memory, so you can build a rich variety of sounds on each lane, 
	this box is made for LiveCoding, so	Every function change is not traced, there is some kind of "not comming back, just forward on time" puzzle, perfect for Improvisation.
	if you close the GUI everything is cleared from memmory. }:[
	
Instructions:
	- Open file CaosBox-v0.08.scd and evaluate all lines:
		+ welcome sound, GUI and CaosBox_liveCodePad-v0.08.scd file automatically opens.
	- Go to CaosBox_liveCodePad-v0.08.scd, change the arguments within instrument functions and evaluate them:
		+ so you can route and change sound qualities.
	- Go to CaosBox GUI: 
		+ start filling the sequencer on its respective instrument channel and alter the signal route with faders and buttons.
	- Improvise, have fun and algorave a lot.	 

Tested on SuperCollider 3.6.3 and above on Linux and Windows.

Work in progress.
